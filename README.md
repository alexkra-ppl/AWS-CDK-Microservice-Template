# AWS CDK Microservice Boilerplate (Python)

This is a template for creating new, container-based, Python Lambda microservices on AWS.

It provides a clean, configurable, and testable starting point. You can create a new, deployable service in minutes by cloning this repo and running a few  commands.

## Features

  * **AWS CDK in Python:** All infrastructure is defined in Python using the AWS CDK.
  * **Container-Based Lambda:** Uses a `Dockerfile` for maximum flexibility and consistency.
  * **Simple CLI:** A `Makefile` provides simple commands like `make deploy` and `make test`.
  * **Configurable Features:** Easily enable or disable optional AWS resources (DynamoDB, SQS) from the command line.
  * **Built-in Testing:**
      * **Infrastructure Tests:** `pytest` tests for your CDK stack (in `tests/test_stack.py`).
      * **Application Tests:** `pytest` tests for your Lambda's business logic (in `tests/test_lambda_handler.py`).

## Getting Started: New Service

Follow these steps to turn this template into your new microservice.

### Step 1: Clone This Repository

Clone this repo into a new directory with your service's name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexkra-ppl/AWS-CDK-Microservice-Template.git new-service
cd new-service
```

### Step 2: Reset Git History

Wipe the template's git history and start your own.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from boilerplate"
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Service

This command will set your unique `service_name` and `stack_name` in the `cdk.json` file.

**Run this command, replacing `microservice-name` with your chosen service name:**

```bash
# This is a required first step
make init name=microservice-name
```

> **Note:** This command can only be run once. If you need to re-run it, you must first manually reset the `service_name` in `cdk.json` back to `"generic-service-name"`.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

This installs all CDK and Python dependencies for your new service using Poetry.

```bash
make install
```

### Step 5: Enable Optional Features (Optional)

Use the built-in `make` commands to enable the AWS resources your service needs.

```bash
# See the current configuration
make status

# Example: Enable DynamoDB
make enable-dynamo

# Example: Enable SQS (as a Lambda trigger)
make enable-sqs
```

### Step 6: Run Tests

Before deploying, run the built-in tests to make sure everything is configured correctly. This runs both infrastructure and application tests.

```bash
make test
```

### Step 7: Deploy to AWS

First, bootstrap your AWS account/region (you only need to do this once per environment). Then, deploy.

> **Prerequisites:**
>
>   * You must have your AWS credentials configured (e.g., via `aws sso login` or environment variables).
>   * You must have Docker running on your machine (for building the Lambda container).

```bash
# Run this once per account/region
make bootstrap

# Deploy your service
make deploy
```

That's it\! New microservice is deployed to AWS.

## How to Develop

1.  **Write Your Business Logic:**
    All your Python code goes in `src/app.py`. Modify the `handler` function to add your logic.
2.  **Write Application Tests:**
    As you add logic to `src/app.py`, add corresponding tests to `tests/test_lambda_handler.py`.
3.  **Add Python Dependencies:**
    To add a new library (like `requests`), run `poetry add requests`. The `Dockerfile` will install it automatically during deployment.
4.  **Redeploy:**
    Run `make deploy` to deploy your changes.

-----

## CLI Commands (Makefile)

All common tasks are run via `make`.

### Configuration

  * `make status`
    Show the current feature status (SQS, DynamoDB).
  * `make enable-sqs` / `make disable-sqs`
    Enable or disable SQS queue creation.
  * `make enable-dynamo` / `make disable-dynamo`
    Enable or disable DynamoDB table creation.

### Deployment

  * `make install`
    Install all Python dependencies with Poetry.
  * `make bootstrap`
    Bootstrap the AWS environment for CDK (first-time use only).
  * `make deploy`
    Synthesize and deploy the service to your AWS account.
  * `make destroy`
    Tear down all resources in the stack.

### Development

  * `make test`
    Run all automated tests (both infrastructure and application logic).
